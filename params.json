{"name":"ozz-animation","tagline":"Open source c++ skeletal animation engine and tools","body":"![logo](images/ozz-grey-128.png)\r\n\r\nozz-animation is an **open source c++ 3d skeletal animation engine**. It provides runtime character animation playback functionalities (loading, sampling, blending...), with full support for Collada and Fbx import formats. It proposes a low-level renderer agnostic and game-engine agnostic implementation, focusing on performance and memory constraints with a data-oriented design.\r\n\r\nozz-animation comes with Collada and Fbx toolchains to convert from major Digital Content Creation formats to ozz optimized runtime structures. Offline libraries are also provided to implement the conversion from any other animation and skeleton format.\r\n\r\n---\r\n![under construction](images/under_construction.png)\r\n\r\nDocumentation is temporarily unavailable while migration to github is in progress.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nContributions are welcome: code review, bug fix, feature implementation...\r\n\r\nozz branching strategy follows [gitflow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
